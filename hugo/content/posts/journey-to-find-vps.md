objectives:
- focus on on-demand vps
- ease of deployment
- pricing 

conclusion:
- time-wise, most providers can deploy vps within 1 min process
- digital ocean is the easiest to use (frequent deployment, toying, etc)

- digitalocean.com digital ocean referral (earn $10 credit): https://m.do.co/c/2daa556e6f4e
    - easy-on-eyes UI
    - need credit card

- google: http://cloud.google.com : free f1-micro (500mb ram, 1vcpu, non-ssd 20gb)
    - UI too cluttered
    - need credit card
    - overkill

- aws: 
    - like google, too many options
    - overkill

- vultr.com
    - nice ui
    - need credit card(?)

- linode.com
    - old ui (they're building new one, they said)
    - need credit card(?)
