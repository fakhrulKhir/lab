### Lesson 8: Technical Interview Techniques

1. 7 steps process during technical interview to make it successful:
    1. clarifying the question
    2. generating inputs & outputs
    3. generating test cases
    4. brainstorming
    5. runtime analysis
    6. coding
    7. debugging
- ***clarify the question***: to make sure that you're solving the right problem

> **IMPORTANT NOTE** 
> you need to prove to the interviewer that you won't dive head first into the problem and potentially write code that doesn't solve the initial issue

- hands-on practice: find island in 2d matrix (only vertical & horizontal, without diagonal). hint: breadth-first problem
- *provoke* the interviewer with possible test-cases (as well as edge cases) to get more hints on how the bigger picture of the problem
- it's always a good idea to think about handling none type in your code
- try to take interviewer's cues to guide you to the solution
- being able to take in interviewer's feedback demonstrates teamwork skill
- do runtime analysis to estimate the efficiency of your code
