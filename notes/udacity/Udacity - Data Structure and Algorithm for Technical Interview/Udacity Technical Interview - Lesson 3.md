### Lesson 3: Searching and Sorting

1. **binary search**: search given item by recursively halving the collection (ordered collection) and check if the median is greater than the item
2. binary search efficiency: `O(log2(n) + 1)`, which basically is same as `O(log2(n))`. hence, the binary search efficiency is `O(log2(n))`.
3. in computer science, log base 2 is more common instead of log base 2 (because we deal with binary a lot)
4. tips to calculate efficiency:
    - create result table
    - identify the pattern
    - convert the pattern into big o notation
5. during interview, your commitment to solve a problem could mean a lot to your interviewer
