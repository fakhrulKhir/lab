### Lesson 2: Finding Lane Lines

- in python, make sure to copy arrays (ie. using `numpy.copy()`) instead of just using `=` (ie. `array_a = array_b`) because it's mutable
- ROI: region of interest
- region masking technique:
    - define thresholds
    - extract region of interest
    - mask color and region selection
