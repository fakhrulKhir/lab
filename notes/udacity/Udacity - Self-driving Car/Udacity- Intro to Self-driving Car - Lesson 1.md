**Instructure:**
1. David Silver
2. Ryan Keenan

### Lesson 1

- current approach for self-driving car:
    - robotic approach (collect data from array of sensors)
    - deep-learning approach (to mimic human behaviour)
- both approach (robotic and deep-learning approach) will be discussed during this nano-degree program

#### project overview (what we gonna do during the program)

**Term 1: Computer Vision and Deep Learning**

- project 1: finding lane lines
- project 2: behavioral cloning (copy/clone human behaviour)
- project 3: advanced lane finding and vehicle detection

**Term 2: Sensor Fusion, Localization, and Control**

- project 4: sensor fusion (integrating different type of sensors)
- project 5: localization (making sense of vehicle's whereabout)
- project 6: controller (steering wheel, etc) → *"it might sound trivial, but it's really easy to screw it up"*

**Term 3: Path Planning & Controlling a Real Self-driving Car**

- project 7: path planning (finding valid sequence of steps)
- project 8: putting code in a real self-driving car
