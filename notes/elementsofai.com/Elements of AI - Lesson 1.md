## Elements of AI

### Chapter 1

- applications of AI:
    1. self-driving cars
    2. content recommendation
        - related implications: filter bubbles, echo-chambers, troll factories, fake news, and new forms of propaganda.
    3. image and video processing
- The popularity of AI in the media is in part due to the fact that people have started using the term when they refer to things that used to be called by other names.
- Why is the public perception of AI is so nebulous?
    - reason 1: no officially agreed definition
    - reason 2: the legacy of science fiction
