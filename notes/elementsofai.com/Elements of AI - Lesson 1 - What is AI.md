## Elements of AI

### Chapter 1

- applications of AI:
    1. self-driving cars
    2. content recommendation
        - related implications: filter bubbles, echo-chambers, troll factories, fake news, and new forms of propaganda.
    3. image and video processing
- The popularity of AI in the media is in part due to the fact that people have started using the term when they refer to things that used to be called by other names.
- Why is the public perception of AI is so nebulous?
    - reason 1: no officially agreed definition
    - reason 2: the legacy of science fiction
- key term in AI:
    - **autonomy**: ability to perform tasks in complex environment without constant guidance by a user
    - **adaptivity**: ability to improve performance by learning from experience
- **suitcase word**: terms that carry a whole bunch of different meanings that come along even if we intend only one of them. coined by ["Marvin Minsky"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky)
- "it would sometimes be more appropriate to talk about the "AIness" (as in happiness or awesomeness) rather than arguing whether something is AI or not."
- *if you'd like to talk like a pro, avoid saying "an AI", and instead say "an AI method".*

### Related fields

- **Machine learning** can be said to be a subfield of AI, which itself is a subfield of computer science. Machine learning enables AI solutions that are adaptive.
    - key term for machine learning: Systems that improve their performance in a given task with more and more experience or data.
- **Deep learning** is a subfield of machine learning. the "depth" in "deep learning" refers to the complexity of a mathematical model employed.
- **Data science** is a recent *umbrella term* (term that covers several subdisciplines) that includes machine learning and statistics, certain aspects of computer science including algorithms, data storage, and web application development
- **Robotics** means building and programming robots so that they can operate in complex, real-world scenarios. In a way, robotics is the ultimate challenge of AI since it requires a combination of virtually all areas of AI, ie. computer vision & speech recognition (for sensing the environment), natural language processing, cognitive modelling & affective computing (for interacting and working with humans).
    - Many of the robotics-related AI problems are best approached by machine learning, which makes machine learning a central branch of AI for robotics.
- "On the other hand, an only-software based solutions such as customer service chatbot, even if they are sometimes called `software robots´ aren´t counted as (real) robotics."
- A convenient way to visualize a taxonomy is an [Euler diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_diagram). A taxonomy does not need to be strictly hierarchical (ie, a discipline can be a subfield of more than one more general topic).

### Philosophy of AI

- in "Turing Test", an entity is intelligent if it cannot be distinguished from another intelligent entity by observing its behavior.
- some of criticism on turing test:
    - "does being human-like mean you are intelligent?"
- **Narrow vs General AI**: Narrow AI refers to AI that handles one task. General AI, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a machine that can handle any intellectual task.
- the ideal of AGI has been all but abandoned by the AI researchers because of lack of progress towards it in more than 50 years despite all the effort. In contrast, narrow AI makes progress in leaps and bounds.
- **Strong vs Weak AI**: Strong AI would amount to a “mind” that is genuinely intelligent and self-conscious (aka. being intelligent). Weak AI is what we actually have, namely systems that exhibit intelligent behaviors despite being “mere“ computers (aka. acting intelligently).
